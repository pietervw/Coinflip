# Flip-The-Coin
Flip the Coin is a simple one-page project that I made to simulate a coin toss for those times that you need to make a yes/no decision and want to leave it up to chance.

There are many coin flip websites online but I wanted something really simple, that works on **mobile** too, and that keeps history of previous tosses.

I've hosted the project on [Flip-The-Coin.com](https://www.flip-the-coin.com) using Github pages.
## Features
* Randomly generates a coin toss
* Saves the result in your browser's local storage, so you can have an overview of past results
* Can be installed as a mobile web app on your phone

## Technology
It's built simply with the following:
* Bootstrap CSS
* Jquery

## Why I use it
The idea was inspired by [Professor Andrew Huberman](https://hubermanlab.com/) who is a neuroscientist. In one of his podcasts he explained that your body's dopamine system functions best when being rewarded randomly. 

He also goes on to explain the dangers of always using "dopamine layers" to make boring tasks bearable. These are things like listening to music while you work out, or taking a pre-workout supplement before hitting the gym. Your body may become dependent on these layers, which reduces the dopamine you get from the enjoyment of the task itself.

Using a simple 50/50 coin toss to decide whether you are going to implement one of these layers makes the use of them more random.
